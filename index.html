    <div class="desc">This is an image of Crash Boat beach in Puerto Rico, Aguadilla. I visit Puerto Rico with my parents every summer to visit my family that lives there. It is my favorite beach and I love to go to Crash Boat beach when I'm in Puerto Rico. It's a great swimming area and is a surfer's paradise.</div>

    <div class="desc">I love to go to Dave & Busters. Dave & Buster's is an American restaurant and entertainment business. Each Dave & Buster's has a full-service restaurant and a video arcade. I enjoy going to Dave & Busters because they have many different kinds of games from exclusive new games to classic video games in the arcade section. They have classics like Pop-A-Shot, Pac-Man, and Skee-Ball, or new games in the Million Dollar Midway. The games are suitable for people of all ages to play.</div>
