    <p><b>It is important to treat others the way you would like to be treated</b><br></br>

    <p><b> It is important to show love and respect to others now more than ever. With the war happening with Ukraine and Russia, it's crucial to treat others with respect and think about how your actions can affect them. The President of Russia is only thinking about how he can benefit his country by attacking Ukraine. The President of Russia is not thinking about how Ukraine is being affected and how many lives have been lost and ruined because of him. The President of Russia is not treating Ukraine with respect or kindness, which resulted with the people in Ukraine suffering and having to migrate to other countries. Therefore, it is important to treat others with respect and love because your actions can change someone's life. Love and respect changes everything. Your decisions and actions can have a big impact in other people's lives. </p>
